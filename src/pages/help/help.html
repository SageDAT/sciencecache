    <li>From the 'Routes' tab, choose a route to visit.  Slide an 'Online Route' to the left and select the 'Save' button to save it to your phone.</li>
    <li>When you are ready, choose your downloaded route from 'Saved Routes' and start your visit, and then use the map or the observation point finder on the route page to navigate to the ScienceCache Observation Points.</li>
    <li>Once you are near the cache, a screen will pop-up telling you that you have arrived near it.</li>
    <li>Look for the cache, which might be a plant, tree, bridge, stream, or marker.</li>
    <li>After you've discovered the cache, click ‘Found it’ to take pictures, answer questions, and turn your hike into a scientific expedition.</li>
    <li>Once you've found all of the observation points for the route you're visiting, you can stop your visit from the route page.</li>
    <li>If your phone is on wifi when you've stopped the visit, you'll be prompted to upload the data (question answers, photos) you've collected to our servers. (You can also upload all of your visits data from the 'Visits' tab.)</li>
